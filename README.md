## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

While working on this project, I reinforced my understanding of HTML and CSS and practiced organizing CSS in an efficient manner. Here is an example of code I'm proud of:

```html
<h1>Recipe Page</h1>
```

```css
.proud-of-this-css {
  color: papayawhip;
}
```

### Continued development

In future projects, I want to focus on improving my JavaScript skills and explore more about CSS preprocessors like SASS to organize CSS better.

### Useful resources

- [MDN Web Docs](https://developer.mozilla.org/) - This is an excellent resource for learning about HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
- [CSS-Tricks](https://css-tricks.com/) - This site has great articles and tips on various CSS techniques.
